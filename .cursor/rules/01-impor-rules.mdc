### Import Rules (STRICT - Unidirectional)

```
shared → (nothing internal)
features → shared only
app → features + shared
agents → shared only
```

**NEVER:**

- Import from one feature into another feature
- Import from app into features/shared
- Import from agents into features
- Use relative imports crossing feature boundaries

### Dependency Direction

- Features are isolated - communicate via shared state/events
- If two features need shared logic, extract to `shared/`
- Agent logic stays separate from UI features
